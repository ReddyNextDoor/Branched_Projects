# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a shell script that analyzes basic server performance statistics on Linux systems. The script will provide system administrators and developers with essential performance metrics to help debug issues and understand server health. The solution will be implemented as a standalone bash script that can be executed on any Linux server without additional dependencies.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to view total CPU usage, so that I can quickly assess the current processor load on the server.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the script is executed THEN the system SHALL display the current total CPU usage as a percentage
2. WHEN CPU usage is calculated THEN the system SHALL use system commands available on standard Linux distributions
3. WHEN displaying CPU usage THEN the system SHALL format the output in a clear, readable manner

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to view memory usage statistics, so that I can understand how much RAM is being utilized versus available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the script is executed THEN the system SHALL display total memory usage showing free vs used memory
2. WHEN memory statistics are shown THEN the system SHALL include both absolute values and percentages
3. WHEN calculating memory usage THEN the system SHALL account for buffers and cache appropriately

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to view disk usage statistics, so that I can monitor storage capacity and prevent disk space issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the script is executed THEN the system SHALL display total disk usage showing free vs used space
2. WHEN disk statistics are shown THEN the system SHALL include both absolute values and percentages
3. WHEN calculating disk usage THEN the system SHALL focus on the root filesystem by default

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to see the top 5 processes by CPU usage, so that I can identify which applications are consuming the most processor resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the script is executed THEN the system SHALL display the top 5 processes consuming the most CPU
2. WHEN showing CPU-intensive processes THEN the system SHALL include process name, PID, and CPU percentage
3. WHEN listing processes THEN the system SHALL sort them by CPU usage in descending order

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to see the top 5 processes by memory usage, so that I can identify which applications are consuming the most RAM.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the script is executed THEN the system SHALL display the top 5 processes consuming the most memory
2. WHEN showing memory-intensive processes THEN the system SHALL include process name, PID, and memory usage
3. WHEN listing processes THEN the system SHALL sort them by memory usage in descending order

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the script to be portable across Linux distributions, so that I can use the same tool on different servers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the script is deployed THEN the system SHALL work on standard Linux distributions without additional dependencies
2. WHEN using system commands THEN the system SHALL use commands commonly available across Linux distributions
3. WHEN the script encounters missing commands THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully

### Requirement 7 (Stretch Goal)

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to view additional system information, so that I can get a comprehensive overview of server status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the script is executed THEN the system MAY display OS version information
2. WHEN the script is executed THEN the system MAY display system uptime
3. WHEN the script is executed THEN the system MAY display current load average
4. WHEN the script is executed THEN the system MAY display currently logged in users
5. WHEN the script is executed THEN the system MAY display recent failed login attempts
